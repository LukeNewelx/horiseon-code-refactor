<h1>Horiseon Code Refactor - <a href="https://lukenewelx.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/"> Link to site</a></h1>
<p> This project is a website for a marketing agency called Horiseon, in this project I refactored existing code to make it more accessible and increase the SEO ratings.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My motivation for this project was to refactor existing code to follow the semantic HTML flow, organise the CSS file and consolidate CSS selectors where possible to ensure it follows the semantic structure. Overall making the website more accessible, improve SEO and drive more traffic.</p>

<p>This consisted of me changing existing code to more fitting semantic elements such as <b>"Header", "Nav", "Section", "Figure", "Aside" and "Article"</b> to name a few. adding Alt tags to images, and correcting anchor tags to ensure the links work correctly.</p>

<h2>Mock Up</h2>
<img src="./assets/images/Screenshot 1.png" alt="Screenshot of the Horiseon website. Targetting the Header, Nav, and Figure."></img>
<img src="./assets/images/Screenshot 2.png" alt="Screenshot of the Horiseon website. Targetting the Article section, and Aside."></img>
<img src="./assets/images/Screenshot 3.png" alt="Screenshot of the Horiseon website. Targetting the bottom half of the Article, Aside and Footer."></img>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This webpage now works the way it was intended, the <b>Nav</b> bar will direct you to specific articles within the page, and it is more accessible.<p>
